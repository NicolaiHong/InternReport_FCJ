### Week 2 Objectives:

- Define and scope the initial typing-game project (key features, microservice boundaries, future matchmaking plans).
- Build team foundations: create a shared repository, seed the backlog, refine ER diagrams, choose tech stack, and assign ownership.
- Standardize formulas for WPM and accuracy.
- Prototype a FastAPI microservice for text generation, sentence assembly, and chat; verify the feasibility of integrating with Bedrock.
- Configure AWS Budgets and alerting.
- Gain hands-on experience with core AWS components: Lambda (function URLs), VPC (subnets, gateways, peering vs transit), VPC Flow Logs, and load-balancing concepts.
- Provision an Amazon RDS instance and design/seed a schema for text retrieval.
- Refactor the text service to use DB-backed retrieval and benchmark it against the prior API-based approach.
- Introduce early operational practices: define roles, run benchmarks, and set up basic monitoring for scalability.

### Week 2 Achievements:

- Scoped the first typing game: defined core functionality, microservice boundaries, populated an initial backlog, and assigned ownership.
- Documented standardized WPM and accuracy calculation methods.
- Initialized a shared repository with a baseline multi-language project layout.
- Refined ER diagrams and drafted the initial relational schema.
- Delivered a FastAPI prototype (text generation, sentence assembly, chat) and validated endpoints through Swagger UI.
- Configured AWS Budgets with a monthly threshold and alert notifications.
- Gained practical knowledge of core AWS building blocks: Lambda (function URLs), VPC (subnets, IGW, NAT, Flow Logs), peering vs transit gateway, and load-balancing basics.
- Evaluated Amazon Bedrock models and validated a candidate model plus prompting strategy.
- Launched an RDS instance, created the schema, and loaded a seed dataset.
- Refactored the TextService to use DB-based retrieval and observed an initial performance improvement in benchmarks.
- Established early operational practices: role assignments, benchmarking focus, and initial scalability considerations.
