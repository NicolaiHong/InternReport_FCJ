### Week 7 Objectives:

- Advance hands-on proficiency with Amazon DynamoDB, covering basic operations, advanced data modeling, and multi-region/global architectures.
- Set up identity federation and IAM role configurations, and apply cost-optimization techniques across AWS and Azure AD.
- Deploy and operate applications using Lightsail, containers, Step Functions, and IAM roles to ensure secure access.
- Use Cloud9, Elastic Beanstalk, and CI/CD tools to automate application delivery pipelines.
- Improve AWS security posture through core IAM best practices, detective controls, incident response, and infrastructure protection.
- Design and automate microservices architectures using Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, and CodeStar.

### Week 7 Achievements:

- Solid practical experience with Amazon DynamoDB: created tables, loaded data, used GSIs and composite keys, enabled backups, and implemented change-data-capture via Streams and Kinesis.

- Performed cost and performance analysis using DynamoDB metrics alongside AWS Glue and Amazon Athena; experimented with tagging to improve cost allocation.

- Implemented identity federation and IAM governance:

  - Configured Azure AD federation to AWS, synchronized IAM roles, and verified federated console access.
  - Created IAM groups, users, and roles with conditional policies (IP- and time-based restrictions).

- Improved cost optimization and database migration skills by evaluating Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, and practicing schema conversion and data migration using AWS SCT and DMS (including DMS Serverless and monitoring).

- Deployed and managed applications on Lightsail and container services: ran WordPress/Prestashop/Akaunting, managed snapshots and alarms, and built custom Docker images for deployment.

- Orchestrated workflows and secured application access:

  - Developed Step Functions workflows (Task, Choice, Wait, Retry/Catch, Parallel).
  - Favored IAM roles over long-lived access keys and attached EC2 roles for secure S3 access.

- Automated application lifecycle and CI/CD:

  - Used Cloud9, CodeStar, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, and Elastic Beanstalk to streamline development and automated deployments.

- Strengthened organizational security posture:

  - Hardened root account practices (MFA), defined admin user/group usage, enforced password policies, explored SCPs, and used IAM Access Analyzer and last-accessed reports to tighten privileges.

- Built microservices and layered security controls:
  - Implemented Lambda-based microservices with DynamoDB and Step Functions, automated deployment via CodeStar, and deployed monitoring/security tools (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Detective) plus network/data protections (VPC design, Network Firewall, WAF, Shield Advanced, Macie, KMS, ACM, Secrets Manager).
