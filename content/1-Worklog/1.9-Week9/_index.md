### Week 9 Achievements:

- Engineered conversational workflows and messaging systems by deploying Amazon Lex chatbots with Lambda hooks and establishing a decoupled SNS Pub/Sub architecture.

- Mastered managed data and caching services:

  - Executed core DynamoDB operations, including GSI management and SDK-based automation.
  - Deployed ElastiCache for Redis clusters, implementing advanced caching patterns like Pub/Sub and Streams.

- Automated Kubernetes lifecycles by provisioning EKS clusters, defining IAM roles, and constructing CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline to streamline application deployment.

- Enforced cloud governance and cost optimization:

  - Audited and managed AWS Service Quotas for scalability.
  - Applied granular IAM policies to restrict resource usage by Region, Instance Type, and Volume characteristics.

- Leveraged EKS Blueprints and IaC to bootstrap network infrastructure, manage multi-team access, and deploy add-ons (Autoscaler) and workloads via ArgoCD.

- Architected modern application solutions:

  - Built a full-stack serverless ride-share app using Amplify, API Gateway, and Lambda.
  - Refactored a monolithic application into microservices, containerized via Docker, and deployed on AWS Fargate.

- Benchmarked storage performance by analyzing S3 throughput and transfer speeds, alongside tuning EFS IOPS and threading configurations.

- Hardened S3 security posture:

  - Enforced encryption and HTTPS, blocked public access via ACLs, and restricted traffic through VPC Endpoints.
  - Utilized AWS Config and Access Analyzer to audit and remediate potential security risks.

- Established a foundational Data Lake: staged data in S3, transformed it via Glue/DataBrew, and enabled analytics with Athena querying and QuickSight visualizations.
