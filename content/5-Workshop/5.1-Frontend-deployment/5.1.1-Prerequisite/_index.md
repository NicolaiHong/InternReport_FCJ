### Cost Expectations for Part 1: Frontend Deployment

**Free Tier Eligible Services:**

- **S3**: 5GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, 2,000 PUT requests (first 12 months)
- **CloudFront**: 1TB data transfer out, 10,000,000 HTTP/HTTPS requests (first 12 months)
- **AWS WAF**: No Free Tier, but minimal cost for basic rules

**Estimated Costs** (if exceeding Free Tier):

- S3 storage: $0.023 per GB per month

- Use small sample files to minimize storage and transfer costs
- Start with basic WAF rules and expand later
