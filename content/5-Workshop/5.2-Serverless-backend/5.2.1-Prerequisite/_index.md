- **Database Basics**: Understanding of relational databases, tables, and SQL queries
- **JSON**: Familiarity with JSON format for API requests/responses
- **Basic Networking**: Understanding of concepts like VPC, subnets, and security groups
- **IAM**: Familiarity with IAM roles and policies. Apply best practice of least-privileges to resources

### Required Technical Skills

- **Programming**: Intermediate knowledge of either:
  - **Node.js** (JavaScript/ TypeScript) - Recommended for this workshop
- **SQL Queries**: Basic SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements
- **API Testing**: Using tools like Postman or curl
- **Command Line**: Comfortable with terminal commands
- **Environment Variables**: Understanding of configuration management

### Required AWS Account Setup

Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account**

   - Active AWS account with administrative access or permissions for:
     - Lambda
     - API Gateway
     - RDS
     - Cognito
     - Secrets Manager
     - VPC
     - IAM
     - CloudWatch Logs

2. **IAM User/Role Permissions**

   - Required managed policies:
     - `AWSLambda_FullAccess`
     - `AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator`
     - `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
     - `AmazonCognitoPowerUser`
     - `SecretsManagerReadWrite`
     - `AmazonVPCFullAccess`
     - `IAMFullAccess` (for creating Lambda execution roles)
     - `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`

3. **Billing Alerts Configured**
   - Set up AWS Budgets or billing alerts
   - Recommended threshold: $20-30 for this workshop
   - RDS can incur higher costs than previous workshop

### Required Tools and Software

Install the following tools on your local machine:

1. **AWS CLI (Version 2) (optional)**

   - Download: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
   - Verify installation: `aws --version`
   - Ensure credentials are configured: `aws configure`

2. **Node.js and npm** (if using Node.js for Lambda)

   - Download: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)
   - Minimum version: Node.js 18.x or higher
   - Verify: `node --version` and `npm --version`

3. **Python** (if using Python for Lambda)

   - Download: https://www.python.org/
   - Minimum version: Python 3.9 or higher
   - Verify: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
   - pip installed: `pip --version`

4. **Git**

   - Download: https://git-scm.com/
   - Verify: `git --version`

5. **Text Editor or IDE**

   - VS Code (recommended): https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Extensions recommended:
     - AWS Toolkit
     - ESLint (for JavaScript)
     - Python (if using Python)

6. **API Testing Tool**

   - **Postman** (recommended): https://www.postman.com/downloads/
   - Or **Insomnia**: https://insomnia.rest/download
   - Or **curl** (command line)

7. **Database Client** (Optional but helpful)
   - **DBeaver** (free, supports PostgreSQL): https://dbeaver.io/
   - Or **pgAdmin**: https://www.pgadmin.org/
   - Or **psql** command line tool

### Sample Application Code

We'll provide sample Lambda function code and SQL scripts:

**Option 1**: Clone the workshop repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-workshop/serverless-app-backend.git
cd serverless-app-backend
```

**Option 2**: Write code from scratch following the workshop

- We'll provide all code snippets in the tutorial
- Good for learning and understanding each component

### Optional: Completed Part 1: Frontend Deployment

While not strictly required, having completed Part 1: Frontend Deployment provides context:

- You'll understand how the frontend will consume these APIs
- You'll have a complete end-to-end application

**If you skipped Part 1: Frontend Deployment:**

- You can still complete this workshop independently
- We'll test APIs using Postman instead of the frontend
- You can integrate with any frontend later

### Cost Expectations for Workshop 2

**Estimated Costs for this Workshop:**

**Within Free Tier (first 12 months):**

- RDS (single-AZ, limited hours): $0-5
- Lambda: $0
- API Gateway: $0
- Cognito: $0
- Secrets Manager: $0 (30-day trial)
- **Total**: $0-5

### Pre-Workshop Checklist

Before beginning, verify you have:

- [ ] AWS account with appropriate permissions
- [ ] AWS CLI installed and configured
- [ ] Node.js/Python installed (based on your preference)
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] Code editor/IDE installed
- [ ] API testing tool installed (Postman recommended)
- [ ] Billing alerts configured at $20
- [ ] Sample code repository cloned (or ready to write from scratch)
- [ ] At least 3-4 hours available for focused work
- [ ] Understanding of REST APIs and databases

### What You'll Learn

By completing this workshop, you will:

- Design and implement serverless API architectures
- Create and configure Lambda functions with proper permissions
- Set up and secure RDS databases in VPC
- Implement API Gateway REST APIs with multiple endpoints
- Configure Cognito user pools and authentication flows
- Integrate Cognito authorizers with API Gateway
- Manage secrets securely with AWS Secrets Manager
- Restrict API Gateway access with Lambda functions and AWS Secrets Manager
- Connect Lambda functions to RDS databases
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Test APIs with authentication tokens

## Ready to Begin?

Once you've completed all prerequisites and verified your setup, you're ready to start building your secure, scalable serverless backend infrastructure!

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you'll have:

- A fully functional REST API with multiple endpoints
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Database-backed data persistence
- Professional logging and monitoring
- Production-ready security practices
- A backend that integrates with your Part 1: Frontend Deployment frontend (if completed)

### Next Step

Let's move on to **Part 1: VPC and Network Setup** to create the secure network foundation for your database and Lambda functions.
