## Overview

In this section, you'll create an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database instance within your VPC. The database will be deployed in a private subnet, making it inaccessible from the internet while still allowing your Lambda functions to connect securely.

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Understand RDS architecture and configuration options
- Create a DB subnet group for RDS deployment
- Configure and launch an RDS PostgreSQL instance
- Set up database parameters and options
- Create initial database schema and tables
- Verify database connectivity
- Understand RDS security and backup settings

**Estimated time**: 35-40 minutes (includes 10-15 min database creation wait time)

## Why Amazon RDS?

### Benefits Over Self-Managed Databases

**Managed Service:**

- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Automated software patching and updates
- Monitoring and metrics built-in
- High availability options (Multi-AZ)
- Read replicas for scaling reads

**Operational Simplicity:**

- No server provisioning or OS management
- Easy scaling of compute and storage
- Automated failover for Multi-AZ deployments
- CloudWatch integration for monitoring

**Cost Efficiency:**

- Pay only for what you use
- Reserved instances for production workloads
- Storage auto-scaling available

## Understanding RDS Configuration

### Costs considerations

For this workshop, we'll use **db.t3.micro**:

- 2 vCPUs, 1 GB RAM
- Burstable performance (suitable for dev/test)
- Free Tier eligible (750 hours/month for first 12 months)
- $0.017/hour (~$12.41/month) outside Free Tier
- Overall: $0 (free-tier) or <$2 (if clean up immediately after workshop)

### Single-AZ vs Multi-AZ

**Single-AZ (Workshop Setup):**

- Database in one Availability Zone
- Lower cost
- Good for development/testing
- ~5 minutes downtime for maintenance

**Multi-AZ (Production):**

- Synchronous replication to standby in different AZ
- Automatic failover (~1-2 minutes)
- Higher cost (~2x)
- Better for production workloads

### Storage Configuration

**Storage Type:** General Purpose SSD (gp3)

- Balance of price and performance
- Burstable IOPS
- Suitable for most workloads

**Allocated Storage:** 20 GB

- Minimum for PostgreSQL
- Free Tier includes 20 GB
- Can be increased later without downtime

## Step 1: Create DB Subnet Group

RDS requires a DB subnet group that defines which subnets the database can be deployed in.

### 1.1 Navigate to RDS Console

1. In AWS Console search bar, type "RDS"
2. Click on **RDS** under Services
3. In the left navigation, click **Subnet groups**

![RDS SG Config](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.3-RDS/1.png)

### 1.2 Create DB Subnet Group

1. Click **Create DB subnet group**

**Subnet group details:**

**Name:** `workshop-db-subnet-group`

**Description:** `Subnet group for workshop RDS database`

**VPC:** Select `workshop-backend-vpc`

### 1.3 Add Subnets

**Availability Zones:**

1. Select 2 availability zones that you create the subnets in the VPC setup in the previous [section]({{< relref "/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless-backend/5.2.2-VPC" >}}#12-create-vpc)
   - Select: `ap-southeast-1a` and `ap-southeast-1b`

**Subnets:**

- Select 2 private subnets, each from different Availability Zone:
  - `workshop-backend-subnet-private3-ap-southeast-1a`
  - `workshop-backend-subnet-private4-ap-southeast-1b`
  - ![RDS SG Config](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.3-RDS/3.png)

![DB Subnet Group Subnets](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.3-RDS/2.png)

**Why Two Subnets?**

Even though we're deploying a single-AZ database, RDS requires the subnet group to have at least two subnets in different Availability Zones. This is an AWS requirement that:

- Allows easy migration to Multi-AZ later
- Provides flexibility for read replicas
- Ensures consistent configuration practices

The database will only use one subnet (we'll specify which one during instance creation).

### 1.4 Create Subnet Group

1. Click **Create**
2. You should see success message
3. Subnet group appears in the list with status **Complete**

![DB Subnet Group Created](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.3-RDS/4.png)

## Step 2: Create RDS PostgreSQL Instance

### 2.1 Start Database Creation

1. In RDS console left navigation, click **Databases**
2. Click **Create database**

### 2.2 Choose Database Creation Method

**Database creation method:**

- Select **Full configuration**
  - Provides full configuration options
  - More control than Easy create

## RDS Best Practices

### Security

**Implemented in this workshop:**

- Database in private subnet (no public access)
- Security group restricting access to Lambda only
- Encryption at rest enabled
- Secrets Manager for storing database credentials

  **For production, also implement:**

- IAM database authentication
- Secrets Manager with automatic rotation
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Regular security patches (auto minor version upgrade enabled)
- CloudWatch alarms for anomalies

### Performance

**Implemented:**

- Appropriate instance class for workload
- gp3 storage for balanced performance
- Indexes on commonly queried columns

  **For production, also consider:**

- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Connection pooling (RDS Proxy)
- Query performance insights
- Proper database configuration tuning

### Availability

**Implemented:**

- Automated backups (7-day retention)
- DB subnet group in multiple AZs

  **For production, also implement:**

- Multi-AZ deployment for automatic failover
- Cross-region read replicas for DR
- Longer backup retention (30 days)
- Backup replication to another region

### Cost Optimization

**Implemented:**

- Free tier (if applicable)
- Right-sized instance (db.t3.micro)
- Single-AZ deployment
- Standard backup retention

  **For production, also consider:**

- Reserved instances for predictable workloads (up to 69% savings)
- Stop database instances during non-business hours (dev/test)
- Storage autoscaling instead of over-provisioning
- Regular review of CloudWatch metrics
