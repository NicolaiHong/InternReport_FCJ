## Overview

In this section, you'll create AWS Lambda functions that serve as the business logic layer of your serverless backend. These functions will handle API requests, retrieve database credentials from Secrets Manager, interact with your RDS database, and return responses to API Gateway.

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Understand Lambda function architecture and execution
- Develop Lambda functions for CRUD operations
- Connect Lambda to RDS PostgreSQL database
- Retrieve credentials securely from Secrets Manager
- Configure VPC settings for database access
- Package and deploy Lambda functions with dependencies
- Test Lambda functions directly
- Set up CloudWatch Logs for debugging
- Initialize database schema via Lambda

**Estimated time**: 60-75 minutes

## Lambda Function Architecture

### What We'll Build

```
API Gateway
    ↓
Lambda Functions (in VPC)
    ├── initDB - Initialize database schema
    ├── createUser - Create new user
    ├── getUsers - List all users
    ├── createTask - Create new task
    ├── getTasks - Get user's tasks
    ├── updateTask - Update task
    └── deleteTask - Delete task
    ↓
VPC Endpoint (Secrets Manager)
    ↓
Secrets Manager (get DB credentials)
    ↓
RDS PostgreSQL (execute queries)
```

## Costs Considerations

### Free-tier:

- **1 million free requests per month**
- **400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month**
  - Applies to both **x86** and **Graviton2** Lambda functions
- **100 GiB of HTTP response streaming per month**
  - The first **6 MB per request is always free**

### Paid-tier

1. Even paid tier cost is minimal for our workshop
2. Overall: <$1 (clean up immediately after finish workshop)

## Step 1: Prepare Lambda Development Environment (optional)

In this step, you'll set up a local development environment for building and packaging your Lambda function.
However, this step is optional. If you prefer not to set up the environment manually, you can skip this step and download source code below.
You can download source code for this part here:

- Github repository: https://github.com/Icyretsz/fcj-workshop-serverless-backend-ver1
- Only the zip file for lambda: https://fcj-workshop-files.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/userHandler.zip

### 1.1 View Project Directory

The source code is provided in the above git repository

The project structure:

```
fcj-workshop-serverless-backend-ver1
└── backend/
    └── src/
        └── userHandler.ts
        └── types.ts
    ├── package.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
```

{{% notice note %}}
You can choose to organize your Lambda functions in different ways. In production, it is recommended to create separate Lambda functions for each user operation (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) to improve maintainability, scalability, and security.<br>
However, for the sake of simplicity in this workshop, we will place all user-related operations into a single Lambda function (userHandler.js).
{{% /notice %}}

#### The userHandler.ts

**Key features of this handler:**

- DB Initialization: creates users table and insert mock data automatically if it doesn’t exist.
- TypeScript types: uses your User interface and ApiResponse<T>.
- Secrets Manager: retrieves database credentials at runtime.
- No connection pool: safe for workshops, simple enough.
- This Lambda function handles CRUD operations for users in a PostgreSQL database. It's designed to work with **API Gateway Lambda Proxy Integration**, which provides a specific event structure and expects a specific response format.

**Supported operations:**

- `GET /users` - Get all users
- `GET /users/{id}` - Get single user
- `POST /users` - Create new user
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Delete user

You can modify it as you like. When you are ready, move on to next steps to build and deploy our
source code to Lambda

## Step 2: Build Lambda Deployment Package

### 2.1 Install dependencies

From root folder, run

```bash
npm install
```

### 2.1 Build TypeScript Code

Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates `dist` folder in root directory

Now find `node_modules` folder then copy it to
`dist` folder

When complete, select all files in `dist` folder, compress them to **zip** and name it userHandler

![project structure](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.5-Lambda/14.png)

Confirm contents of userHandler.zip

### 3.5 Test Lambda function

Now let's test the Lambda function. We will test the get all users route

1. In the **Code** tab of your Lambda function, click the **Test** button or **Create new test event** on the left sidebar
2. A drawer on the right will appear
3. Configure the test event:
   - Event name: `test-get-users`
   - Event JSON:

```JSON
{
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "pathParameters": null,
    "body": null
}
```

4. Click **Save**

5. You will see your new test event in the left sidebar, hover on it and then click the play button to start the test

![event](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.5-Lambda/18.png)

6. If everything goes well, you will see the response with status 200 and a body contains our users

![response](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.5-Lambda/19.png)

## Step 4: Monitor Lambda with CloudWatch Logs

### 4.1 View CloudWatch Logs

1. In Lambda console, click **Monitor** tab
2. Click **View CloudWatch logs**

![Lambda Monitor Tab](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.5-Lambda/20.png)

3. Click on the latest **Log stream**

![CloudWatch Log Streams](/images/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless/5.2.5-Lambda/21.png)

### 4.2 Analyze Log Entries

You should see detailed logs for each invocation:

```
2024-11-29T10:00:00.000Z INFO [users-handler] process start.
2024-11-29T10:00:00.100Z INFO Failed to get secret: Error: Could not retrieve secret
2024-11-29T10:00:00.150Z INFO Connected to RDS PostgreSQL successfully.
2024-11-29T10:00:00.200Z INFO Inserting demo users...
2024-11-29T10:00:00.250Z INFO Demo users inserted.
2024-11-29T10:00:00.300Z INFO [users-handler] process end.
```

**Key things to observe:**

- Successful database connection
- Table initialization
- Demo data insertion (first run only)
- Request method and path
- Query execution and results

### 4.3 Understanding Log Output

**Successful Create User:**

```
START RequestId: abc-123-def
[INFO] [users-handler] process start.
[INFO] Connected to RDS PostgreSQL successfully.
[INFO] Demo users inserted.
END RequestId: abc-123-def
REPORT RequestId: abc-123-def Duration: 1250.34 ms Billed Duration: 1251 ms Memory Size: 512 MB Max Memory Used: 128 MB Init Duration: 2345.67 ms
```

**What each metric means:**

- **Duration:** Actual execution time (1250.34 ms)
- **Billed Duration:** Rounded up time you're charged for (1251 ms)
- **Memory Size:** Allocated memory (512 MB)
- **Max Memory Used:** Peak memory usage (128 MB)
- **Init Duration:** Cold start initialization time (2345.67 ms, first invocation only)

**Error Example:**

```
START RequestId: xyz-789-abc
[INFO] [users-handler] process start.
[ERROR] Failed to get secret: ResourceNotFoundException: Secret not found
[ERROR] RDS connection failed: Error: Connection timeout
[INFO] [users-handler] process end.
END RequestId: xyz-789-abc
REPORT RequestId: xyz-789-abc Duration: 5000.12 ms Billed Duration: 5001 ms Memory Size: 512 MB Max Memory Used: 95 MB
```

### 4.4 Filter Logs by Pattern

CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to query logs with SQL-like syntax.

1. In CloudWatch Logs, click **Logs Insights** in left navigation
2. Select your log group: `/aws/lambda/workshop-lambda-sm-rds`
3. Enter a query
4. Click **Run query**

**Example queries:**

**Find all errors:**

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

**Find slow requests (> 2 seconds):**

```sql
fields @timestamp, @duration
| filter @type = "REPORT"
| filter @duration > 2000
| sort @duration desc
| limit 20
```

**Count requests by HTTP method:**

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /httpMethod/
| parse @message '"httpMethod":"*"' as method
| stats count() by method
```

**Find database connection errors:**

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /RDS connection failed/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

**Get average execution time:**

```sql
fields @timestamp, @duration
| filter @type = "REPORT"
| stats avg(@duration) as avg_duration, max(@duration) as max_duration, min(@duration) as min_duration
```
