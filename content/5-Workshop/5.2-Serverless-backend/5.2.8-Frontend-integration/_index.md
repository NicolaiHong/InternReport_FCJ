## Overview

In this section, you'll finally combine what we have built so far in the backend to connect to our CloudFront frontend we setup in the previous part.

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Configure Lambda function to include CORS headers
- Configure API Gateway CORS settings
- Configure Cognito callback URL and login URL to your CloudFront endpoint
- Test the application CRUD operations

**Estimated time**: 30 minutes

## Step 1: Configure Lambda function

Since we are calling our APIs from a different origin (CloudFront) , we have to configure CORS headers properly

1. Go to Lambda console, select **workshop-lambda-sm-rds**
2. View the `response` function, this function will inlude proper CORS headers in the responses
3. Make sure the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is set with your CloudFront endpoint

```javascript
function respond(statusCode, payload) {
  return {
    statusCode,
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://[cloudfront-id].cloudfront.net", //add your CloudFront endpoint here
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "OPTIONS,POST,GET,DELETE",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  };
}
```

- This makes sure that the APIs are only allow to be called from trusted origin (which is your CloudFront front-end)

## Step 2: Configure API Gateway CORS settings of resources

- Make sure that you have set the correct CORS settings in our `/users` and `/{id}` resouces. We have already done this in [5.2.6 - API Gateway setup]({{< relref "/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless-backend/5.2.6-API-Gateway" >}}#29-enable-cors-on-each-resources)

## Step 3: Configure Cognito callback URL and login URL to your CloudFront endpoint

- We already done this in [5.2.7 - Cognito]({{< relref "/5-Workshop/5.2-Serverless-backend/5.2.7-Cognito" >}}#72-configure-allowed-callback-urls)

## Step 4: Test the application

1. Go to your CloudFront endpoint

2. Click **Sign in**
3. You will be redirected to the hosted login UI

4. Upon succesful login, you will be redirected to the homepage.
5. The homepage will display your information and tokens, along with the user list fetched from RDS

6. You can test CRUD operations
