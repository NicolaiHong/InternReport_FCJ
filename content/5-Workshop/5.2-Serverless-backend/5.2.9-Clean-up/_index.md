## Overview

This section covers how to properly clean up the resources you created during Part 2: Serverless Backend. Cleaning up is important to avoid ongoing AWS charges, especially for resources that have monthly costs like RDS.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to safely delete resources in the correct order
- Understanding resource dependencies
- Cost implications of keeping vs. deleting resources
- How to preserve configuration for future use
- Partial cleanup options

**Estimated time**: 15-20 minutes

## Should You Clean Up?

### Keep Resources If:

- You're proceeding immediately to Part 2: Serverless Backend
- You want to maintain the working frontend for reference
- You're using this for a real project
- Costs are acceptable for your use case

### Clean Up If:

- You've completed the workshop and don't need the resources
- You want to minimize AWS costs
- You're practicing and will recreate later
- You're approaching Free Tier limits
