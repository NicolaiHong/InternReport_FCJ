### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment was friendly, open, and supportive. FCJ members were always willing to help whenever I faced difficulties, even outside regular working hours. The workspace was well-organized and comfortable, which helped me stay focused. However, I think additional team bonding or social activities would strengthen connections among interns and team members.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided clear and detailed guidance, explained concepts thoroughly, and encouraged me to ask questions whenever I was unsure. The admin team handled administrative matters smoothly, provided the required documents, and ensured I had everything I needed to work effectively. I especially appreciated that my mentor encouraged me to explore solutions on my own instead of simply giving me the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I worked on aligned well with what I learned at university while also exposing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This helped reinforce my foundational knowledge while giving me hands-on practical experience.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Throughout the internship, I learned many valuable skills, such as using project management tools, collaborating in a team environment, and communicating professionally. My mentor also shared practical industry insights that helped me better shape my future career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture was positive and respectful. Everyone worked seriously but maintained an enjoyable atmosphere. During urgent tasks or deadlines, team members were always willing to support each other regardless of their roles. This made me feel included as part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provided an internship allowance and offered flexible working hours when necessary. Additionally, being able to join internal training sessions was a significant advantage.
