Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects.

	"content": "VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

These components work together to simulate on-premises DNS forwarding and name resolution.\nDeploy the CloudFormation stack The CloudFormation template will create additional services to support an on-premises simulation:\nOne Route 53 Private Hosted Zone that hosts Alias records for the PrivateLink S3 endpoint One Route 53 Inbound Resolver endpoint that enables \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; to resolve inbound DNS resolution requests to the Private Hosted Zone One Route 53 Outbound Resolver endpoint that enables \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; to forward DNS requests for S3 to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; Click the following link to open the AWS CloudFormation console. The required template will be pre-loaded into the menu. Accept all default and click Create stack. It may take a few minutes for stack deployment to complete. You can continue with the next step without waiting for the deployemnt to finish.\nUpdate on-premise private route table This workshop uses a strongSwan VPN running on an EC2 instance to simulate connectivty between an on-premises datacenter and the AWS cloud. Most of the required components are provisioned before your start. To finalize the VPN configuration, you will modify the \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; routing table to direct traffic destined for the cloud to the strongSwan VPN instance.\nOpen the Amazon EC2 console\nSelect the instance named infra-vpngw-test. From the Details tab, copy the Instance ID and paste this into your text editor\nNavigate to the VPC menu by using the Search box at the top of the browser window.\nClick on Route Tables, select the RT Private On-prem route table, select the Routes tab, and click Edit Routes.\nClick Add route.

	"content": " ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only. Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nIn this section, you need to summarize the contents of the workshop that you plan to conduct.\nIoT Weather Platform for Lab Research A Unified AWS Serverless Solution for Real-Time Weather Monitoring 1. Executive Summary The IoT Weather Platform is designed for the ITea Lab team in Ho Chi Minh City to enhance weather data collection and analysis. It supports up to 5 weather stations, with potential scalability to 10-15, utilizing Raspberry Pi edge devices with ESP32 sensors to transmit data via MQTT. The platform leverages AWS Serverless services to deliver real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and cost efficiency, with access restricted to 5 lab members via Amazon Cognito.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current weather stations require manual data collection, becoming unmanageable with multiple units. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are costly and overly complex.\nThe Solution The platform uses AWS IoT Core to ingest MQTT data, AWS Lambda and API Gateway for processing, Amazon S3 for storage (including a data lake), and AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load data from the S3 data lake to another S3 bucket for analysis. AWS Amplify with Next.js provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to Thingsboard and CoreIoT, users can register new devices and manage connections, though this platform operates on a smaller scale and is designed for private use. Key features include real-time dashboards, trend analysis, and low operational costs.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The solution establishes a foundational resource for lab members to develop a larger IoT platform, serving as a study resource, and provides a data foundation for AI enthusiasts for model training or analysis. It reduces manual reporting for each station via a centralized platform, simplifying management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. Monthly costs are $0.66 USD per the AWS Pricing Calculator, with a 12-month total of $7.92 USD. All IoT equipment costs are covered by the existing weather station setup, eliminating additional development expenses. The break-even period of 6-12 months is achieved through significant time savings from reduced manual work.\n3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a serverless AWS architecture to manage data from 5 Raspberry Pi-based stations, scalable to 15. Data is ingested via AWS IoT Core, stored in an S3 data lake, and processed by AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to transform and load it into another S3 bucket for analysis. Lambda and API Gateway handle additional processing, while Amplify with Next.js hosts the dashboard, secured by Cognito. The architecture is detailed below:\nAWS Services Used AWS IoT Core: Ingests MQTT data from 5 stations, scalable to 15. AWS Lambda: Processes data and triggers Glue jobs (two functions). Amazon API Gateway: Facilitates web app communication. Amazon S3: Stores raw data in a data lake and processed outputs (two buckets). AWS Glue: Crawlers catalog data, and ETL jobs transform and load it. AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js web interface. Amazon Cognito: Secures access for lab users. Component Design Edge Devices: Raspberry Pi collects and filters sensor data, sending it to IoT Core. Data Ingestion: AWS IoT Core receives MQTT messages from the edge devices. Data Storage: Raw data is stored in an S3 data lake; processed data is stored in another S3 bucket. Data Processing: AWS Glue Crawlers catalog the data, and ETL jobs transform it for analysis. Web Interface: AWS Amplify hosts a Next.js app for real-time dashboards and analytics. User Management: Amazon Cognito manages user access, allowing up to 5 active accounts. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases This project has two parts—setting up weather edge stations and building the weather platform—each following 4 phases:\nBuild Theory and Draw Architecture: Research Raspberry Pi setup with ESP32 sensors and design the AWS serverless architecture (1 month pre-internship) Calculate Price and Check Practicality: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and adjust if needed (Month 1). Fix Architecture for Cost or Solution Fit: Tweak the design (e.g., optimize Lambda with Next.js) to stay cost-effective and usable (Month 2). Develop, Test, and Deploy: Code the Raspberry Pi setup, AWS services with CDK/SDK, and Next.js app, then test and release to production (Months 2-3). Technical Requirements\nWeather Edge Station: Sensors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed), a microcontroller (ESP32), and a Raspberry Pi as the edge device. Raspberry Pi runs Raspbian, handles Docker for filtering, and sends 1 MB/day per station via MQTT over Wi-Fi. Weather Platform: Practical knowledge of AWS Amplify (hosting Next.js), Lambda (minimal use due to Next.js), AWS Glue (ETL), S3 (two buckets), IoT Core (gateway and rules), and Cognito (5 users). Use AWS CDK/SDK to code interactions (e.g., IoT Core rules to S3). Next.js reduces Lambda workload for the fullstack web app. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline\nPre-Internship (Month 0): 1 month for planning and old station review. Internship (Months 1-3): 3 months. Month 1: Study AWS and upgrade hardware. Month 2: Design and adjust architecture. Month 3: Implement, test, and launch. Post-Launch: Up to 1 year for research. 6. Budget Estimation You can find the budget estimation on the AWS Pricing Calculator.\nOr you can download the Budget Estimation File.\nInfrastructure Costs AWS Services: AWS Lambda: $0.00/month (1,000 requests, 512 MB storage). S3 Standard: $0.15/month (6 GB, 2,100 requests, 1 GB scanned). Data Transfer: $0.02/month (1 GB inbound, 1 GB outbound). AWS Amplify: $0.35/month (256 MB, 500 ms requests). Amazon API Gateway: $0.01/month (2,000 requests). AWS Glue ETL Jobs: $0.02/month (2 DPUs). AWS Glue Crawlers: $0.07/month (1 crawler). MQTT (IoT Core): $0.08/month (5 devices, 45,000 messages). Total: $0.7/month, $8.40/12 months\nHardware: $265 one-time (Raspberry Pi 5 and sensors). 7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Network Outages: Medium impact, medium probability. Sensor Failures: High impact, low probability. Cost Overruns: Medium impact, low probability. Mitigation Strategies Network: Local storage on Raspberry Pi with Docker. Sensors: Regular checks and spares. Cost: AWS budget alerts and optimization. Contingency Plans Revert to manual methods if AWS fails. Use CloudFormation for cost-related rollbacks. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements: Real-time data and analytics replace manual processes.\nScalable to 10-15 stations.\nLong-term Value 1-year data foundation for AI research.\nReusable for future projects.\n"

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3. "

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

	"content": "When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier.

The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. { \u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"
